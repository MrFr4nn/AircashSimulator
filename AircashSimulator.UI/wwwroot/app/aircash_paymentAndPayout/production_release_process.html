    <h1>Production release process</h1>

    <p>
        The production process consists of several steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                All acceptance criteria are checked and are performing in line with expectations
            </li>
            <li>
                Aircash support will add partner in Aircash production system and allow access to Aircash production system from the partner IP addresses
            </li>
            <li>
                The partner will test connection to production on a single location (if possible) in order to test integration in “silent” production
            </li>
            <li>After first 3 steps are in line with expectations, the partner will enable service on all locations</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>Acceptance criteria</h4>
    <p>
        To release the production service, several tests should be made to check if the integration is done correctly and it is ready for production.

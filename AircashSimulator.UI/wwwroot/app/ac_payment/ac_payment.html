    This chapter describes the top up process using the Aircash application. The described
    process explains how the user can transfer funds from the Aircash system to the partner system.
    <br />
    <br />
    The transfer process consists of three steps:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Check if user exists in partner system (CheckPlayer)</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user within the Aircash application must enter a unique identifier of his account
                    in the partner system
                </li>
                <li>
                    A unique identifier may consist of one or more parameters, but must uniquely
                    indicate where the user funds will be transferred
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case the user is not sure which identifier to use, it is best to contact Aircash
                    support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the purpose of this verification, the partner system has to provide an access
                    point for Aircash to send parameters and to get an answer whether the entered
                    identifier is valid.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>User Invoice</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    After a successful check, the Aircash system will create a user template for the
                    payment transaction
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user is required to provide the funds and pay the above mentioned by selecting
                    one of the offered Aircash marketplace deposit methods

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Payment to Partner Account (CreateAndConfirmTransaction)</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    After receiving funds, Aircash reports to the partner system that the user has made a
                    payment to the account (the unique identifier entered in step 1)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The partner system is obliged to provide an access point through which
                    funds are transferred to the user's system
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

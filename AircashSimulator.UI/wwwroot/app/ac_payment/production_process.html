    <h1 style="text-align:justify">Production process</h1>
    <p>
        The production process consists of several steps that take place sequentially:
        <ol>
            <li>
                All acceptance criteria are checked and are performing in line with expectations
            </li>
            <li>
                The partner will push his service to production and define addresses for CheckPlayer and
                CreateAndConfirmTransaction method
            </li>
            <li>
                Aircash will enable the partner payment option for several users in Aircash application to
                test integration in production environment
            </li>
            <li>
                After the first 3 steps are in line with expectations, Aircash will enable partner payment
                for all users
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:justify">Acceptance criteria</h2>
    <p>
        To release the service in the production, you need to make several tests to see if the integration is
        well-made and ready for production

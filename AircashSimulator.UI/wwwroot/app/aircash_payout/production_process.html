    <h1>Production process</h1>
    <p>
        The production process consists of several steps:
        <ol>
            <li>All acceptance criteria are checked and are performing in line with expectations</li>
            <li>
                Aircash support will add partner in Aircash production system and allow access to Aircash production system from the partner IP addresses
            </li>
            <li>
                The partner will test connection to production and allow payments for individual users (if possible) in order to test integration in “silent” production
            </li>
            <li>
                After the first 3 steps are in line with expectations, the partner will enable service for all user
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Acceptance criteria</h2>
    <p>
        To release the production service, several tests should be made to check if the integration is done correctly and it is ready for production.

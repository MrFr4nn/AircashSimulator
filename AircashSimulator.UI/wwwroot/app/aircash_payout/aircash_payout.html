<h1>Payout process</h1>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify">
    This chapter describes the payment process. The described process explains how the user can transfer assets from the Partner system to the Aircash system.<br />
    The transfer process consists of three steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Partner User Check (CheckUser)
        <ul>
            <li>
                The user within the partner system inputs the number of mobile phone he used while registering in the Aircash application
            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile phone is unique user identifier in Aircash system
            </li>
            <li>
                The partner system can use this method to verify whether the user with the specified number exists in the Aircash system
            </li>
            <li>
                The implementation of this method on a partner system is not mandatory, but is recommended by Aircash
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Partner Confirm transaction (CreatePayout)
        <ul>
            <li>
                The user inputs transaction amount, along with phone number from step
            </li>
            <li>
                On the user confirmation to make a payment, the partner system reserves the user's funds in partner system from the account and the partner system makes request to the Aircash system
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        in the case of a successful payment, partner should confirm transaction in the partner system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        in the case of a known error from the Aircash system, the funds can be returned to the user's account with the appropriate message
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the case of an unknown error the partner system is obliged to leave the reserved funds until the problem is resolved
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                In the case of successful execution of this method, the Aircash system provides funds to the user account with which it has
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Partner Check Transaction Status (CheckTransactionStatus)
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the case of an unknown payment error, the error recovery can be automated by checking the transaction status in the Aircash system
            </li>
            <li>
                The implementation of this method is not necessary, but it is recommended.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>ProcessCardPurchase</h4>
<p>
    This method processes a card purchase transaction submitted by a sales partner. It requires
    detailed transaction information including partner ID, location ID, reference number,
    transaction code, amount, and currency ISO code. The method verifies the integrity and
    authenticity of the request, checks for the validity of the provided parameters, and processes
    the card purchase if all validations pass.
</p>
<p>
    The method ensures that each transaction is uniquely identified by its reference number and
    can be linked back to the specific sales partner and location from where it originated. This
    is crucial for maintaining a secure and traceable transaction record.
</p>
<p>
    In case of errors or validation failures, the method returns appropriate error responses
    indicating the nature of the problem. It is important for the calling system to handle these
    responses accordingly to ensure smooth operation.
</p>
<p>
    Successful transactions are confirmed with a response indicating success, and the details
    of the transaction are logged and processed for settlement.

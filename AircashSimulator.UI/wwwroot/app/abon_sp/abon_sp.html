<p style="text-align:justify">
    Aircash Abon platform is intended for users that wish to make payments to their Online Provider accounts (betting sites, parking services, GSM topups etc.) via paper coupons that can be bought at cash registers, i.e. points of sale of Aircash Sales Partners (kiosks, gas stations, etc.). The process of using Aircash Abon can be observed from two perspectives: Sales Partner and Online Provider.
    <br /> <br />
    From the Sale Partner's perspective: the user comes to the cash register at a Sale Partner point of sale and asks to buy an Aircash Abon coupon a specific value. The cash register system then contacts the Aircash backend system which then creates a coupon of the desired value. After that, the user pays for that amount, and the cash register prints out an Aircash Abon coupon which is then given to the user.
    <br /> <br />
    From the Online Provider's perspective: the user logs in to a website or a mobile app of an Online Provider (e.g. a booking site), and chooses to deposit money via an Aircash Abon coupon. He enters the 16-digit code from the coupon he bought, and confirms the transaction of funds to an Online Provider account. The funds are deposited to the user's online account, and the coupon gets expended and can no longer be used.

<h1 style="text-align:justify">Technical integration aspects – security and authentication</h1>
<p>
    Aircash Abon system exposes a REST web API.
    <br /> <br />
    The API is accessed via HTTPS protocol (secured by a TLS certificate). Optionally, we can ensure access to the API through a VPN.
    <br /> <br />
    Each request towards Aircash Abon API has to be digitally signed. This ensures non-repudiation of every request, as well as authentication.
    <br /> <br />
    Each method has a special PartnerId parameter. This is a GUID type parameter that's also generated by the Aircash team and delivered to each Sales Partner separately.
    <br /> <br />
    Only a pair of properly signed control sequences and a correct PartnerId can enable authentication to the system.
    <br /> <br />
    The partners are provided with an integration environment (staging) where it is possible to test all of the methods for integration. All the integration details of the Abon services are described in detail in the following chapters.

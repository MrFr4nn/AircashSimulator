<h1>Deposit process</h1>
<p>
    This chapter describes the deposit process using the Aircash application. The described process explains how
    the user can scan the QR code and top up the slot machine.
</p>
<p></p>>The transfer process consists of three steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Scanning the QR code (ReadCode)
        <ul>
            <li>
                After the user scans the QR code, Aircash will check the status of the slot machine by sending the
                ReadCode request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensico platform will return the payment status of the machine along with the initiated transaction id
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        User payment
        <ul>
            <li>
                The user needs to enter the amount within the Aircash application and confirm the transaction
            </li>
            <li>
                User will have the option to confirm or reject transaction payment. If the transaction is rejected, the
                Aircash system will not send the confirmation request.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction confirmation (ConfirmTransaction)
        <ul>
            <li>
                The partner system is obliged to provide an access point through which funds are transferred to the
                slot machine - a request to this endpoint will be sent once the user confirms the transaction
            </li>
            <li>
                Partner system must ensure that transaction is confirmed and processed only once as Aircash can
                confirm one transaction several times in case of network issues
            </li>
            <li>
                Partner system must acknowledge each processed transaction to Aircash system
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h1>Withdrawal process</h1>

<p>
    This chapter describes the withdrawal process using the Aircash application. The described process explains
    how the user can scan the QR code and withdraw the funds from the slot machine.
</p>
<p>The transfer process consists of two steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Scanning the QR code (ReadCode)
        <ul>
            <li>
                After the user scans the QR code, Aircash will check the status of the slot machine by sending the
                ReadCode request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensico platform will return the withdrawal status of the machine
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create payout
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the status of the slot machine is pending withdrawal, the Ensico platform should send a
                CreatePayout request with the phone number provided in the ReadCode request
            </li>
            <li>
                Aircash will receive the request and top up the user’s wallet
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h1>User flow</h1>

<h4>User deposit flow</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Using the Aircash application (Scan&Pay), the user scans the QR code printed on the frontal slot machine part
    </li>
    <li>
        The user enters the amount he wants to deposit
        <ol type="a">
            <li>If the user enters the amount below the minimum, Aircash will display an error message</li>
            <li>If the user enters the amount above the maximum, Aircash will display an error message</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        The user confirms the transaction and the slot machine is credited
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>User withdrawal flow</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The user clicks the collect button on slot machine</li>
    <li>
        The user opens his Aircash application and using the Scan&Pay option, scans the QR code printed on the
        frontal slot machine part
    </li>
    <li>
        After scanning the QR code, the Aircash application will display the information message to the user notifying
        him that the withdrawal transaction is processing
    </li>
    <li>
        The user receives a notification and the wallet is credited
    </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h1>API</h1>

<h4>Methods called by Aircash on the partner system</h4>

<p>
    The Partner should open two REST method that receives JSON objects in order to successfully process transactions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ReadCode - the method used by the Aircash to check the status of the slot machine.
    </li>
    <li>
        ConfirmTransaction - the method used by the Aircash to confirm the deposit transaction.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>Methods called by partner system on the Aircash system</h4>

<p>In case of the withdrawal process, Aircash will provide REST method that receives JSON objects:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CreatePayout
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All methods should have common behavior in case of responses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In case of successful response: HTTP 200 OK message with JSON content
    </li>
    <li>
        In case of server error: HTTP response 500 Server error
    </li>
    <li>
        In case of bad request: HTTP response 400 Bad request with json content about error
    </li>
    <li>
        In case of invalid signature: 401 Unauthorized
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>ReadCode</h4>

<p>
    The method is used by the Aircash platform to check the status of the slot machine. The Enciso platform should
    enable the REST API endpoint to which the Aircash platform will send a request after the user scans the QR code
    printed on the slot machine.

<h4>ConfirmTransaction</h4>

<p>
    The method used by the Aircash system to notify the Ensico platform to process the deposit transaction identified by
    the PartnerTransactionID from the ReadCode response:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If the transaction is a deposit request, the Aircash will send the amount that needs to be added to the slot
        machine
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Aircash will send the request after the user confirms the deposit within the Aircash application. This method should
    be idempotent, so in case of any failure, Aircash will repeat the request with the same parameters.

<h1>Technical connectivity features</h1>

<h4>Access</h4>

<p>
    The partner system should enable the HTTPS / TLS 1.2 protocol on its access points. It is also desirable to
    make a restriction on the specified access points by the IP address of the Aircash system. The Aircash test will send
    requests from the address 212.83.162.238
</p>

<h4>Authentication</h4>

<p>Authentication is achieved with digital signature on each request:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        In case of the requests towards partner’s system, Aircash will use the private key to generate signature and
        partner system will verify it.
    </li>
    <li>
        In case of the requests towards Aircash system, partner will use the private key to generate signature and
        Aircash system will verify it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Signature</h4>

<p>
    In order to achieve the undeniability of the requests exchanged between the Aircash and the Ensico system, the
    digital signature will be exchanged in each request. The Aircash signature is generated so that all the parameters are
    ordered alphabetically, and then the pairs of parameter names and parameter values are joined into a single string.
    This string is then signed with a private certificate. After receiving the request, the opposite side is required to
    generate a string that matches the one signed by the sender and check its validity using the Signature and the public
    certificate (which will be exchanged before the start of integration).
</p>

<p>Rules when generating the signature</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        For complex objects, the parameter order is alphabetical
    </li>
    <li>
        For lists, the parameter order is always the same as it was received, and parameters are joined by a comma
    </li>
    <li>
        For each parameter, the parameter name is printed first, and then the value joined by an equation symbol
    </li>
    <li>
        In case the value of a parameter is empty or null, only the parameter name is printed and the value is
        skipped
    </li>
    <li>
        all parameters are connected with sign &
    </li>
</ul>

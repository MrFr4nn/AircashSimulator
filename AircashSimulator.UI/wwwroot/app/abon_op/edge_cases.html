        <h4>ConfirmTransaction method – invalid or no response</h4>
        <p>
            In the case of an unsuccessful ConfirmTransaction call, the following error recovery methods should be
            applied:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Call ConfirmTransaction with same parameters</li>
            <li>
                If the response is error 400: 4 "Coupon Already Used", and the PartnerTransactionId (this is the
                parameter that the Online Provider has to set in the ConfirmTransaction call in order to check
                the transaction status later) in additional data matches the one that was sent – the coupon can
                be confirmed on the Online Provider side and the transaction can be processed
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Alternatively:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Call method ValidateCoupon with required parameters</li>
            <li>
                If the coupon was used (IsValid == false) and ProviderTransactionId parameter matches the one
                that was being currently sent in ConfirmTransaction, the coupon can be confirmed on the Online
                Provider side and the transaction can be processed
            </li>
            <li>
                If the coupon is valid (IsValid == true) and ProviderTransactionId is empty - the transaction was
                not processed on the Abon side, and you should call ConfirmTransaction again
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h4>ValidateCoupon method – invalid or no response</h4>
        <p>In case the Online Provider doesn't get a response, the request can be retried.</p>

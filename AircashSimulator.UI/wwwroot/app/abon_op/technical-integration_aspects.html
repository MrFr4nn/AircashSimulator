<br />
<h4>Security and authentication</h4>
<p>
    Aircash Abon system exposes a REST API.
</p>
<p>
    The API is accessed via HTTPS protocol (secured by a TLS certificate).
</p>
<p>
    Each request towards Aircash Abon API has to be digitally signed. This ensures non-repudiation of every request, as well as authentication.
</p>
<p>
    Certificate used for signing are generated as described in the <a href="https://dev-simulator.aircash.eu/#!/app/signature">Signature</a> chapter.
</p>
<p>
    Each method has a special ProviderId parameter. This is a GUID type parameter that's generated by the Aircash team and delivered to each Online Provider separately.
</p>
<p>
    The partners are provided with an integration environment (staging) where it is possible to test all of the
    methods for integration. Integration details of the Abon services are described in
    detail in the following chapters.

<h4>Checkbox – I accept Abon Terms & Conditions</h4>
<p>
    In order for the users to use Abon services on the Online Provider's website, they have to accept the
    terms and conditions beforehand.
</p>
<p>
    Every Online Provider is obliged to add a checkbox for the Abon terms and conditions, which is by
    default always checked.
</p>
<p>
    The checkbox has to contain a link to Abon Terms and Conditions:
</p>
<div class="note note-gray-400 col-md-8">
    <div class="note-content">
        <code>
            &lta href="https://abon.cash/terms-conditions-en/" rel="nofollow"&gtI accept the Abon Terms&Conditions&lt/a&gt
        </code>
    </div>

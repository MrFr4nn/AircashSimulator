        <p>
            Aircash Frame integration enables multiple Aircash services using a single endpoint. Connect your cashier directly to the Aircash Frame API to process:
            <ol>
                <li>Payments via Aircash application</li>
                <li>Deposits via Abon voucher</li>
                <li>Withdrawals to Aircash application</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>SDK</h2>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>
            There are two ways to integrate with Aircash Frame; Window Checkout and Redirect Checkout. Each of them will be described in its own section,
            including the required parameters and how to use the script after initiating. To use the Aircash Frame checkout script, the partner’s system
            must include a minified Javascript file on the web application. The partner's system is also responsible to ensure that script is loaded before
            calling any of the functions in it. This is an example how to load/include script:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>< script src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/aircash-dev/o/Frame%2Fjs%2Faircashframe-sdk-web.min.js?alt=media">< /script></code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            Aircash will provide a link to the script additionally.
        </p>
        <h4>Integration types</h4>
        <h5>Window Checkout</h5>
        <p>
            This integration type offers you a solution where, with a few passed parameters to Aircash Frame SDK, script opens a new window with Aircash Frame
            in it. After finishing the transaction it will close and handle the rest of the process for you.
            Below are the required parameters for initiating a transaction:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      ... //rest of the parameters for API v2</code>
<code>      "successUrl": null,                                     //this must be 'null' when using this type of checkout</code>
<code>      "declineUrl": null,                                     //this must be 'null' when using this type of checkout</code>
<code>      "cancelUrl": null,                                      //this must be 'null' when using this type of checkout</code>
<code>      "originUrl": "https://domain.com",                      //this must be domain where your web application runs Aircash Frame SDK</code>
<code>      ... //rest of the parameters for API v2</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            After a successful transaction initiate Aircash Frame will return the following response:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      "transactionId": "c125ba7d-afb5-4ce5-ac3c-33af420200cf",</code>
<code>      "url": "https://frame.aircash.eu/c125ba7d-afb5-4ce5-ac3c-33af420200cf"</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            When the partner's system gets a response from Aircash Frame it's necessary to call the SDK function which
            can be done as in the following example:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  new AircashFrame.WindowCheckout({</code>
<code>      transactionId: response.transactionId,                  //this is a "TransactionId" parameter from the Aircash Frame system response</code>
<code>      onSuccess: onSuccess,                                   //a function that's needed to be defined in the partner's system, it's called after successful transaction</code>
<code>      onDecline: onDecline,                                   //a function that's needed to be defined in the partner's system, it's called after declined transaction</code>
<code>      onCancel: onCancel,                                     //a function that's needed to be defined in the partner's system, it's called after transaction cancel by user through an 'x' button in the AC Frame</code>
<code>      originUrl: "https://yourwebclientapplication.com",      //partner's system web application domain, this is where is SDK loaded from</code>
<code>      debug: true,                                            //optional parameter, send 'true' if you want a debugging logs in the browser console</code>
<code>      environment: "staging"                                  //default parameter if not sent, possible values are: localhost, development, staging and production</code>
<code>  });</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            It's recommended but not mandatory that onSuccess, onDecline and onCancel functions support receiving JSON
            object as the Aircash Frame system on calling these functions will send a JSON object with details of the
            transaction. An example of the payload is below:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      "amount": 100.0,</code>
<code>      "currencyId": 978                                       //ISO-4217 currency code</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            In case of user closes window by pressing 'close' button in browser, onCancel function is called with the following payload:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      "byUser": true</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>

        <hr />
        <h5>Redirect Checkout</h5>
        <p>
            This integration type offers you a simple checkout solution where, with a few passed parameters, a client will be fully redirected to
            the Aircash Frame system and after finishing the transaction, Frame system will redirect to one of the predefined URLs depending on
            transaction status. Below are the required parameters for initiating a transaction:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      ... //rest of the parameters for API v2</code>
<code>      "successUrl": "https://domain.com/success",             //this is the URL where the client will be redirected after successfull transaction</code>
<code>      "declineUrl":"https://domain.com/decline",              //this is the URL where the client will be redirected after declined transaction</code>
<code>      "cancelUrl":"https://domain.com/cancel",                //this is the URL where the client will be redirected after manual transaction cancelation</code>
<code>      "originUrl": null,                                      //this must be 'null' when using this type of checkout</code>
<code>      ... //rest of the parameters for API v2</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            After a successful transaction initiate Aircash Frame will return the following response:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  {</code>
<code>      "transactionId": "c125ba7d-afb5-4ce5-ac3c-33af420200cf",</code>
<code>      "url": "https://frame.aircash.eu/c125ba7d-afb5-4ce5-ac3c-33af420200cf"</code>
<code>  }</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            When the partner's system gets a response from Aircash Frame it's necessary to call the SDK function
            which can be done as in the following example:
        </p>
        <uib-tabset>
            <uib-tab index="checkUser1-tab-2" heading="Withdrawal" classes="nav-item" style="display:none">
                <pre>
<code>  new AircashFrame.RedirectCheckout({</code>
<code>      transactionId: response.transactionId,                  //this is a "TransactionId" parameter from the Aircash Frame system response</code>
<code>      debug: true,                                            //optional parameter, send 'true' if you want a debugging logs in the browser console</code>
<code>      environment: "staging"                                  //default parameter if not sent, possible values are: localhost, development, staging and production</code>
<code>  });</code>
</pre>
            </uib-tab>
        </uib-tabset>
        <p>
            Now, the client will be fully redirected to the Aircash Frame and after finishing the transaction it
            will be returned (redirected) to one of the URLs defined by the partner's system on transaction initiation.
        </p>

        <h5>Custom implementation for redirect checkout</h5>

        <p>
            This is your custom implementation of Aircash Frame integration. You can display Aircash Frame on any possible way that seems the best for your
            requirements. For example, you can open new web browser’s window (blank or with your origin URL or any other URL) and use custom redirect to
            Aircash Frame URL which you will receive in the Initiate method response body. In this case you have complete control over window where Aircash
            Frame is displayed, you can implement your scripts to handle window open, window close and window redirect to your success URL.
        </p>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <b>A:</b>&nbsp;
                        We are calling your NotificationURL when the transaction is processed (when a user scans the QR code and clicks in Aircash mobile app "Pay" or when the user clicks on
                        "x" in Aircash Frame). NotificationURL is defined by your side when you are calling out the method "Initiate" to display Aircash Frame. After the transaction is processed (successful
                        transaction, declined transaction, or canceled transaction) we are calling one time your NotificationURL. After the first call of your NotificationURL, if we receive a different response
                        than OK(200) we will call your NotificationURL two more times.
                        <br />
                        The main task of NotificationURL is to notify your system that the transaction is completed. It is your job to check what is the status of the transaction by sending the requests to our
                        "status" method. If, for any reason, you haven't received the notification (network issue i.e.) you still need to ensure to check the status of the transaction on our end.
                        <br />
                        For example, if we agree to have a transaction timeframe of 5 minutes (within which the user needs to confirm the payment), and you haven't received the notification, your system will
                        need to check the transaction status without being notified. These are corner cases but still may occur.

                        (like saving the phone number for future payments) which are based on the value of partnerUserId . Still, the importance of having this value depends on the type of the merchant. For example,
                        e-commerce merchants are low-risk categorized so we could have here some random value, UUID for example (which is not fixed). If you have that info we should use it for its real purpose, otherwise,
                        send us some random value (only because it is required).

                        <b>A:</b>&nbsp; Aircash marketplace deposit is a deposit method via Aircash Marketplace which is placed in the Aircash native mobile app. In the marketplace,
                        the user will choose the merchant logo, and he will need to enter the amount and identification parameter (email or username). Compared to the
                        Aircash Frame implementation, deposit transaction starts in the Aircash native app (not at the merchant cashier). AircashPayment integration includes
                        the implementation of the "CheckPlayer" method and the "CreateAndConfirmPayment" method.

                        call your NotificationUrl and the transaction will be in status 1 – declined. If for any reason (network problems etc.) the notification is not received,
                        you can call the Status method 30 seconds after the Aircash Frame timer expired to make sure there was not any network or other issues and make sure you

                <h2>Aircash Withdrawal</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    This chapter describes the withdrawal process. The described process explains how the user can transfer assets from the Partner's system to the Aircash system.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process consists of the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The user selects Aircash as the payout option and enters the amount he wants to withdraw.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner’s system initiates the payout with the amount, currency, transaction id and other
                        mandatory parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aircash system responds with a URL to which user needs to be redirected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aircash withdrawal form is displayed to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A user enters mobile phone number to which he wants to make payout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aircash will check wheather the user exists in the Aircash system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user exists and all prerequisites are met to receive the payout, Aircash will send a push notification to let the partner system know that the payout is ready to receive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner system needs to check the status within the Aircash system by sending status request. If Aircash system responds with pending status, partner system can reserve the funds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the reserved funds are ready to be confirmed (either manually or automatically), partner system needs to send final Confirmation request to Aircash system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upon receiving the confirmation request, Aircash system will top up the Aircash account.
                    </li>
                </ol>

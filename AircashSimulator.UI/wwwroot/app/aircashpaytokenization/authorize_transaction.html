    <h1>AuthorizeTransaction</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
        Authorization is the first step of the payment process where Aircash users will need to perform authentication. Authentication will be handled completely on the Aircash side and the partner system will only receive end result of the authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authorization allows the partner systems to use tokenization in the process. Tokenization is part of the authentication process where the Aircash system will generate a token that is connected to the Aircash wallet which the partner system can use to perform the frictionless payment. In case of token use, the Aircash system can still request authentication from the end-user based on Aircash Risk rules for that merchant. In the case of low-risk merchants, these risk rules will monitor only suspicious behavior of the users on that merchant and in case of common use from the end-users, the flow will be frictionless to the end-user.

        <h1>Payment process</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            This chapter describes the payment process using the Aircash application. The described process explains
            how the user can pay the transaction in the partner system by scanning the QR code
        </p>
        <p>
            The transfer process consists of two steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>User payment</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Payment process starts with opening the Aircash application and selecting the Scan
                        and Pay option from the home screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner needs to ensure the correctness of the QR code which is being scanned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a user takes a photo of that code via Aircash app, Aircash system will display
                        information to the user about the transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User will have option to confirm or reject transaction payment
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Transaction confirmation (ConfirmTransaction)</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once user confirm transaction Aircash system will send information to partner
                        system about payment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The partner system is obliged to provide an access point through which Aircash will
                        notify partner about the transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner system must ensure that transaction is confirmed and processed only once as
                        Aircash can confirm one transaction several times in case of network issues
                    </li>
                    <li>Partner system must acknowledge each processed transaction to Aircash system</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Access</h2>
        <p>
            The partner system should enable the HTTPS / TLS 1.2 protocol on its access points
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h1>Methods called by Aircash on the partner system</h1>
        <p>
            The Partner should open one REST method that receives JSON objects in order to successfully
            confirm transactions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Methods called by partner system on the Aircash system</h2>
        <p>
            Aircash will provide two REST methods that receive JSON objects. First method is mandatory
            in implementation and that is code generation. Second method is transaction cancellation. Once the
            transaction is confirmed the partner has the ability to cancel the transaction and return funds to the
            user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each method partner should send header Content-Type with value application/json
        </p>
        <p>
            All Aircash methods have common behaviour in case of responses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In case of successful response Aircash system will return HTTP response 200 OK with JSON
                content in response.
            </li>
            <li>In case of server error Aircash system will return HTTP response 500 Server error</li>
            <li>
                In case of bad request Aircash system will return HTTP response 400 Bad request with json
                content about error
            </li>
            <li>In case of invalid partner ID or invalid signature, Aircash system will return 401 Unauthorized</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />

        <h4>Static QR code</h4>
        <p>
            Each QR code uniquely defines amount for the device or location that is going to be paid by scanning the QR code.

        <h4>ConfirmTransaction</h4>
        <p>
            Once the user scans the QR code and confirms the transaction, Aircash system will send a
            confirmation message towards the partner system. Partner system should process that message and
            return a successful response in case of successful processing. In case Aircash system doesn’t receive
            successful response Aircash system will retry this request several times after which it will notify
            Aircash support upon unsuccessful confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>Partner should provide an url where Aircash will send all transaction confirmations.</p>

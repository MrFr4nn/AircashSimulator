<h2>Matching User's Personal Data</h2>
<br />
<p>For territories with AML regulations (i.e. Germany) that are requesting identity validation and verification we need to 
    ensure that the person on the merchant side is the same one on the Aircash side. This can be achieved by comparing the 
    following parameters: First name, Last name, and Birth date. So if the result of the personal data match is false, then 
    the transaction should be declined.

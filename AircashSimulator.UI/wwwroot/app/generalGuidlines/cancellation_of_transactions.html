    <h2>Cancellation of transactions</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Regarding the cancellation, it is done always manually, in coordination with Aircash Customer Support.</p>
    <p>If the transaction is successful, and later on needs to be canceled, we need to receive (via email sent to info@aircash.eu) the transaction details (transaction ids, date and time, amount) of the transaction that needs to be canceled.</p>

    <p>The flow/procedure for the <b>Aircash Payment (Aircash marketplace deposit)</b> and <b>Aircash Pay</b> via Aircash Frame would be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user makes a deposit of 100 EUR and the funds are approved on his (merchant’s) account</li>
        <li>
            The user requires a cancellation/refund
            <ul>
                <li>if the user asks Aircash customer support to make a refund, we will redirect him to merchant customer support</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Merchant customer support marks the transaction as canceled (funds deducted from his online account</li>
        <li>Merchant customer support sends the email to Aircash customer support asking for the cancellation</li>
        <li>Aircash customer support cancels the transaction and the funds are back in the Aircash wallet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The flow/procedure for the <b>Aircash Payout (withdrawal)</b> would be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user makes a withdrawal of 100 EUR and the funds are approved on his Aircash wallet</li>
        <li>The user requires a cancellation/refund </li>
        <li>
            Merchant customer support sends the email to Aircash customer support asking for the cancellation
            <ul>
                <li>note that in the withdrawal this is an important step - funds first need to be deducted from his Aircash wallet</li>
                <li>Aircash customer support will be able to cancel the withdrawal only if the funds are still available on the Aircash wallet</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>After confirmation from Aircash Customer support, Merchant customer support can mark the transaction as canceled (funds are returned to the user’s online account)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Abon</b> deposits cannot be canceled or refunded, after the voucher is consumed its state cannot be changed.</p>

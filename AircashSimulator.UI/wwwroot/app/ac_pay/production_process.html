    <h1>Production process</h1>
    <br />
    <p>The production process consists of several steps that take place sequentially:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>All acceptance criteria are checked and are performing in line with expectations</li>
        <li>
            The partner will push his service to production and define address for Confirm
            Transaction method
        </li>
        <li>Aircash will enable partner in production</li>
        <li>If possible partner will generate one test transaction in production</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h4>Acceptance criteria</h4>
    <br />
    <p>
        To release the service in the production, you need to make several tests to see if the integration is
        well-made and ready for production

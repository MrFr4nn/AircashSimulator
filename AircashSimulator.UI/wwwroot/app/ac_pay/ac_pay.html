        <h1>Payment process</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            This chapter describes the top up process using the Aircash application. The described
            process explains how the user can pay the invoice in the partner system using AircashPay.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transfer process consists of three steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Generate transaction code (GeneratePartnerCode)</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Partner system must send information to the Aircash system in order to generate
                        payment code for invoice/transaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transaction must have partnerid, currency, amount and some unique transaction
                        identifier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner system should display transaction code on invoice/POS so that user can take
                        photo of that code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In case integration is done for multiple business entities, integration must have
                        option to send different partnerid for each transaction
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>User payment</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once a user takes a photo of that code via Aircash app, Aircash system will display
                        information to the user about the transaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>User will have option to confirm or reject transaction payment</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Transaction confirmation (ConfirmTransaction)</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once user confirm transaction Aircash system will send information to partner
                        system about payment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The partner system is obliged to provide an access point through which funds are
                        transferred to the user's account
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Partner system must ensure that transaction is confirmed and processed only once
                        as Aircash can confirm one transaction several times in case of network issues
                    </li>
                    <li>Partner system must acknowledge each processed transaction to Aircash system</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Methods called by Aircash on the partner system</h1>
        <p>
            The Partner should open one REST method that receives JSON objects in order to successfully
            confirm transactions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Methods called by partner system on the Aircash system</h2>
        <p>
            Aircash will provide two REST methods that receive JSON objects. First method is mandatory
            in implementation and that is code generation. Second method is transaction cancellation. Once the
            transaction is confirmed the partner has the ability to cancel the transaction and return funds to the
            user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each method partner should send header Content-Type with value application/json
        </p>
        <p>
            All Aircash methods have common behaviour in case of responses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In case of successful response Aircash system will return HTTP response 200 OK with JSON
                content in response.
            </li>
            <li>In case of server error Aircash system will return HTTP response 500 Server error</li>
            <li>
                In case of bad request Aircash system will return HTTP response 400 Bad request with json
                content about error
            </li>
            <li>In case of invalid partner ID or invalid signature, Aircash system will return 401 Unauthorized</li>
        </ul>

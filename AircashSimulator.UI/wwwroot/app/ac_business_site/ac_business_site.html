<h1>Aircash business site (back-office portal)</h1>
<br />
<p>
    Aircash back-office portal is a web-based application used for tracking transactions that are
    processed on the Aircash system.
</p>
<p>
    To open an account, a partner needs to send a request to <a href="">info@aircash.eu</a> containing an email of the
    user. Aircash will create an account and send credentials (username and password) to the email from
    the request. After the first login, a user will be requested to change his password.
</p>
<p>
    After a successful login, the user will be able to use the following features:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Transactions – table with all successful transactions on the Aircash system. Transactions
            can be filtered (transaction id, location id, period or service – issued and canceled) and
            exported to CSV
        </li>
        <li>
            Coupon – used for coupon cancellation. Each coupon can be canceled by entering the
            serial number of the coupon.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Technical requirements for using Aircash back office portal are access to the Internet and a web
    browser (Chrome recommended).
